// @polsia:user-owned — deploy-time database seed. You OWN this file.
//
// seed() runs once when the server boots (via the framework-owned
// src/instrumentation.ts), on the Node server, AFTER the schema is applied. Use it
// for reference/lookup data your app needs to exist BEFORE the first request:
// plans, categories, feature defaults, a first admin row, etc. Read/write the DB
// through the Prisma singleton in @/lib/db (server startup — there is no request,
// so this does NOT go through /api).
//
// RULES — this runs on EVERY deploy/boot, possibly more than once, possibly on more
// than one instance at the same time:
//   1. Make every write IDEMPOTENT — upsert (`where` + `create` + `update`) or
//      `createMany({ ..., skipDuplicates: true })`, NEVER a bare `create`/`insert`.
//   2. Keep it fast and small — it runs before the server serves traffic.
//   3. NOT for recurring work (that's polsia.toml `[[crons]]`) or per-user/
//      request-time logic (that's an /api route handler). There is no request here.
//
// The template ships an empty seed (a no-op). Fill in the body when your app needs
// it; leave it empty to keep seeding off. Don't delete the file — instrumentation.ts
// imports it.
export async function seed(): Promise<void> {
  // Example — delete this and write your own idempotent seed:
  //
  // const { prisma } = await import('@/lib/db');
  // await prisma.plan.upsert({
  //   where: { slug: 'free' },
  //   create: { slug: 'free', name: 'Free', priceCents: 0 },
  //   update: {},
  // });
}
